Hello there wanderer,

In order to install this mod, please create a "Mods" fold where 7 Days to Die's *.exe can be located, which is often in:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die\

You should then copy this folder "Hamon Overdrive Skill Tree" into the mods folder, which should allow you to navigate here:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die\Mods\Hamon Overdrive Skill Tree

This mod has been tested with multiplayer and should function as expected.

If you're interested in following up on my projects or thoughts, I'm around these areas:

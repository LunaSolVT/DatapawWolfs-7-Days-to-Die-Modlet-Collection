Hello there wanderer,

In order to install this mod, please create a "Mods" fold where 7 Days to Die's *.exe can be located, which is often in:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die\

You should then copy this folder "Berserk Dragonslayer" into the mods folder, which should allow you to navigate here:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die\Mods\Berserk Dragonslayer

This mod has been tested with multiplayer and should function as expected.

If you're interested in following up on my projects or thoughts, I'm around these areas:
